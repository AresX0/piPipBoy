Fonts and assets
=================

This project uses open fonts for the Pip‑Boy aesthetic. We do not include proprietary assets in the repo.

Recommended fonts (open/free):
- DejaVu Sans / DejaVu Sans Mono (public domain-like)
- Noto Sans / Noto Sans Mono (SIL/Apache-compatible)

To install locally on a Raspberry Pi:
- sudo apt install fonts-dejavu-core fonts-noto

If you want to bundle a font with the app, ensure it is licensed for redistribution and add it under `resources/fonts/`.
