# piPipBoy — Raspberry Pi Pip-Boy prototype

This repository includes a small prototype (`raspi_pipboy/`) integrating the `piboy` upstream apps into a Pygame runner.

- See `raspi_pipboy/README.piPipBoy.md` for detailed quickstart, license attribution, and run instructions.
- CI: a minimal CI workflow exists at `.github/workflows/ci-minimal.yml` that runs the import smoke tests.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add more CI (matrix builds, Windows support, or build/test of the runner),
- Add a release packaging workflow for Raspberry Pi.
