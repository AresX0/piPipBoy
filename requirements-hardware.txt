# Optional hardware dependencies for Raspberry Pi (install only on Pi when needed)
# Suggested packages:

# - opencv-python  (cv2 fallback for cameras)
# - rpi_ws281x      (WS281x LED strips)
# - luma.oled       (I2C OLED displays)
# - gpiozero        (GPIO / PWM helpers) or RPi.GPIO
# - pillow          (PIL, used by luma and image encoding)
